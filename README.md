Marlowe is special-purpose language for financial contracts on Cardano, allowing contracts to be written in the language of finance, rather than using a general-purpose language on the blockchain. Because it is special-purpose, it is easier to read, write and understand Marlowe contracts. It is also safer: some sorts of errors are impossible to write, and we can completely analyse contract behaviour without having to run a contract.
